# DayZ_InternalSimple
just an internal with a console lol
If ya'll didn't know, I've been learning since 2/26/2024. Today marks the day(6/19/2024), where I made my own internal that iterates through the near entity table and fetches the x,y,z of each entity. 
It is very simple, this is not meant as a release, but a marking of my journey that yall can learn off of too. I finally broke through the annoying layer of trying to learn the basics, I can now make decent console based internal/external for x86 and x64.
Next, my new route and task is to finally get good at reversing, I have a grasp of Cheat Engine and Reclass, now I need to refine those skills and become the master of them. Then I'll introduce ghidra/IDA. That is a whole journey in its self lmao.
